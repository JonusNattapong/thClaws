# Chapter 1 — What is thClaws?

![logo](../user-manual-img/logo/thClaws-logo-line-art-banner.png)

thClaws is a **native-Rust AI Agent Platform** that runs locally on
your machine — for building AI Agents that help with a wide range of
work: writing code, automating workflows, reviewing and organizing
documents, managing knowledge bases, or assembling teams of agents
that work together. All in one binary. You tell it what you want in
natural language; it reads
your files, runs commands, uses tools, and talks back to you while it
works.

Six surfaces ship as one binary, sharing a single `Agent` loop,
`Session`, and tool registry — the first five are for a single person
(including chatting through LINE on your phone), the sixth lets other
software hire thClaws to do work:

- **Desktop GUI** (`thclaws` with no flags) — a native window with a
  Terminal tab running the same interactive REPL as `--cli` mode, a
  streaming Chat tab, a Files browser, and an optional Team tab.
- **CLI REPL** (`thclaws --cli`) — an interactive terminal prompt for
  SSH sessions, headless servers, or when you want zero GUI overhead.
- **Non-interactive mode** (`thclaws -p "prompt"`, long form `--print`)
  — runs a single turn and exits. Handy for scripts, CI pipelines, and
  shell one-liners. Add `-v` / `--verbose` to see per-turn token usage
  on stderr without polluting stdout.
- **Webapp** (`thclaws --serve --port 7878` + open a browser) — same
  engine over WebSocket/HTTP, served from your laptop. Reach it
  remotely via SSH tunnel for "thClaws anywhere" without opening a
  port.
- **LINE Chat** (`thclaws --line` or GUI Line Connect modal) — chat
  with your agent through your own LINE Official Account. Goes
  through a relay tunnel at `line.thclaws.ai` that bridges the LINE
  platform and the thClaws running on your machine — the agent stays
  local but you can reach it from anywhere via your phone (see
  [Chapter 21](ch21-line-and-browser-chat.md)).
- **AI Agent (API server)** (`thclaws --serve` + HTTP API) — lets
  *other software* (orchestrators, external clients, schedulers) call
  thClaws as an agent over the same HTTP API — details in later
  chapters.

## What makes it different

- **Multi-provider.** Anthropic (native + Claude Agent SDK via Claude
  Code auth), OpenAI (Chat Completions + Responses/Codex), Google
  Gemini & Gemma, Alibaba DashScope (Qwen), DeepSeek, Z.ai (GLM Coding
  Plan), NVIDIA NIM, NSTDA Thai LLM (OpenThaiGPT, Typhoon, Pathumma,
  THaLLE), OpenRouter, Agentic Press, Azure AI Foundry, Ollama (local,
  local Anthropic-compatible, and Ollama Cloud), LMStudio, plus a
  generic **OpenAI-compatible** slot (`oai/*`) for LiteLLM / Portkey /
  Helicone / vLLM / internal proxies — auto-detected by model name
  prefix. Switch models mid-session with `/model` (validated against
  the provider's catalogue) or swap the whole provider with `/provider`.
- **Any knowledge worker, not just engineers.** The Chat tab is a
  streaming conversation panel anyone can drive — researchers,
  analysts, PMs, ops, legal, marketing, finance. Ask in natural
  language; the agent reads your files, edits documents, searches
  your knowledge base, drafts outputs. Engineers prefer the Terminal
  tab's REPL. Both share the same sessions and config, so a mixed
  team can switch between interfaces freely without losing context.
- **File viewer & editor in the Files tab.** A working-directory file
  tree with a syntax-highlighted preview pane (CodeMirror 6, ~40
  languages) and server-rendered GFM markdown in a sandboxed iframe.
  Click the pencil icon to edit `.md` in a WYSIWYG editor (TipTap) or
  code in a highlighted editor (CodeMirror) — Cmd/Ctrl+S to save,
  native OS confirm dialog before discarding edits. Auto-refresh
  polling pauses while you're editing so concurrent `Write`/`Edit`
  tool calls from the agent can't clobber your in-progress buffer.
- **Open standards, not a walled garden.** thClaws is built on the
  conventions the agent-tooling industry is converging on, not on
  bespoke formats you have to learn only for us. The
  [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for
  tool servers. [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md) for project
  instructions — the vendor-neutral standard stewarded by the Agentic
  AI Foundation and adopted by Google, OpenAI, Factory, Sourcegraph,
  and Cursor. `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter for packaged workflows.
  `.mcp.json` for MCP server configuration. Your configuration is
  portable — between thClaws, other agents that speak the same
  standards, and whatever comes next.
- **Skills.** Reusable expert workflows packaged as a directory with
  `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + Markdown instructions the model
  follows) and optional scripts. The agent picks the right skill
  automatically when a user request matches the `whenToUse` trigger,
  or you can invoke one explicitly as `/<skill-name>`. Install with
  `/skill install` from a git URL or `.zip` archive. Discovery looks
  in `.thclaws/skills/`, `~/.config/thclaws/skills/`, plus
  `.claude/skills/` as a fallback location.
- **MCP servers.** The Model Context Protocol lets you plug in tools
  built by third parties — GitHub, filesystems, databases, browsers,
  Slack, and more. Both stdio (spawned subprocess) and HTTP Streamable
  transports are supported, with OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for protected
  servers. Add one with `/mcp add` or ship a `.mcp.json` in your
  project; discovered tools are namespaced by server name and the
  agent can call them like any built-in.
- **Plugin system.** Skills + commands + agent definitions + MCP
  servers bundled under a single manifest (`.thclaws-plugin/plugin.json`
  or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), installable from a git URL or a
  `.zip` archive. One install, one uninstall, one version to pin —
  ideal for sharing a team's extensions.
- **Memory & project instructions.** Drop an `AGENTS.md` (or
  `CLAUDE.md`) in your repo — thClaws walks up from cwd and injects
  every match into the system prompt, the same way git resolves
  `.gitignore`. A
  separate persistent memory store at `~/.config/thclaws/memory/`
  holds longer-lived facts the agent has learned about you, your
  preferences, and each project, classified as `user` / `feedback` /
  `project` / `reference` and indexed as markdown files you can read,
  edit, or commit. Both survive restart.
- **Knowledge bases (KMS).** Per-project and per-user wikis the agent
  can search and read on demand. Drop markdown pages under
  `.thclaws/kms/<name>/pages/`, give each a one-line entry in
  `index.md`, tick the box in the sidebar, and the agent gets a
  table of contents every turn plus a full mutation surface
  (`KmsRead` / `KmsSearch` / `KmsWrite` / `KmsAppend` / `KmsDelete`)
  for active wiki maintenance. No embeddings — grep + read, following
  Andrej Karpathy's LLM-wiki pattern. Run `/dream` and a built-in
  side-channel agent mines the 10 most recent sessions, dedupes pages,
  surfaces new insights, and writes a dated audit-trail page — review
  with `git diff`.
- **API-ready for standard tooling.** `--serve` exposes
  `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible for Cursor, Aider, n8n,
  openai-python) and `/agent/run` + `/v1/agent/info` (thClaws-native
  for orchestrators like thcompany). One agent instance can serve
  humans and other software at the same time.
- **Async webhook delivery.** Long-running runs (deploys, builds,
  multi-step research) send the prompt + `x_callback` and close the
  connection; thClaws POSTs the terminal result back when done.
  Survives network blips and orchestrator pod restarts mid-flight.
- **Transparent cost tracking.** Built-in model catalogue carries
  per-token-type pricing (input / output / cached read / cache write /
  reasoning) sourced from
  [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm). Every turn's `usage`
  block reports all five fields so orchestrators / UIs can compute
  cost locally without asking the provider.
- **Three tiers of agent orchestration.**
  - **`Task` tool** — model-driven subagents that block the parent's
    turn. Each gets its own tool registry, recurses up to 3 levels
    deep. Right when the parent's reasoning should decide whether and
    when to delegate.
  - **`/agent <name> <prompt>`** — user-driven concurrent
    side-channels. Spawned on a fresh tokio task, runs in parallel with
    main, never enters main's history, has its own cancel token. Right
    when *you* know exactly what you want a specialist to do
    (`/agent translator แปลไฟล์ x` while you keep coding).
  - **Agent Teams** — multiple thClaws processes coordinating through
    a shared mailbox and task queue, each teammate in its own tmux
    pane and optional git worktree. One agent writes your backend
    while a teammate builds the frontend in parallel; lead calls
    `TeamMerge` when both are done.
- **Plan mode.** For multi-step work, the agent can `EnterPlanMode`,
  propose an ordered list of steps, and let *you* review and approve
  before execution. Each step runs sequentially with its own retry
  budget; failures stop the chain so you can decide. Same UX in GUI
  (sidebar with Approve / Cancel / Skip / Retry per step) and REPL
  (`/plan` slash command).
- **Schedule recurring jobs.** `/schedule add` runs an agent on cron
  (`0 9 * * MON-FRI`), at fixed intervals, or whenever a watched
  directory changes (`watchWorkspace`). Three composable layers:
  manual `/schedule run`, in-process scheduler (lives as long as your
  REPL), and a native daemon (`launchd` on macOS / `systemd-user` on
  Linux) that survives reboots. Per-job working directory, optional
  model override, full output capture.
- **Long-running loops & overnight builds.** `/loop` for
  fixed-interval iteration. `/goal` for audit-driven completion (the
  agent works toward a goal until an audit prompt confirms "done" or
  hits the budget). Compose them: `/goal --auto` is a Ralph-style
  overnight builder that keeps going until the goal is satisfied or
  you wake up.
- **Document workflow.** Native PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX read + edit +
  create tools, plus image rendering. The agent can ingest a 50-page
  PDF, summarize it into KMS, and produce a follow-up PowerPoint deck
  — all in one conversation, no separate file-conversion step.
- **Hooks.** Run shell scripts on agent lifecycle events:
  `pre_tool_use`, `post_tool_use`, `permission_denied`, `session_start`,
  `pre_compact`, etc. Audit every Bash invocation, gate `Edit`/`Write`
  through your linter, fire a Slack notification when long sessions
  end. Eight events × per-event environment variables × timeout-with-
  SIGKILL guarantees.
- **Settings.** Every runtime knob — permission mode, thinking budget,
  allowed/disallowed tools, provider endpoints, KMS attachments,
  max output tokens — is one JSON file: `.thclaws/settings.json`
  (project, commit it with the repo) or
  `~/.config/thclaws/settings.json` (user-global).
  `~/.claude/settings.json` is read as a fallback location. API
  keys go in the OS keychain by default (Windows Credential Manager
  / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) with `.env` fallback for
  CI and headless servers. The gear icon in the desktop GUI is a
  visual editor for keys, global/folder `AGENTS.md`, and the secrets
  backend choice.
- **Session resume.** `thclaws --resume last` picks up where you left
  off; `thclaws --resume <id>` jumps to a specific session. Sessions
  live as JSONL under `.thclaws/sessions/` — git-friendly,
  grep-friendly, never opaque.
- **Safety first.** A filesystem sandbox scopes file tools to the
  working directory. Destructive shell commands are flagged before
  execution. You approve every mutating tool call unless you've opted
  into auto-approve. Permission requests label which agent is asking
  when multiple are running concurrently (main vs. side-channel vs.
  subagent), so you don't approve a translator's `Bash` thinking it's
  main's.
- **Offline-capable.** Ollama (native and Anthropic-compat) lets you run
  entirely against a local model.
- **Deploy what you build.** thClaws doesn't stop at authoring —
  ship the landing pages, web apps, APIs, and AI agents you create
  through [Agentic Press Hosting](https://agentic-press.com)
  (partnered with SIS Cloud Service and Artech.Cloud) or any other
  host you prefer. Schedule agents on cron, respond to webhooks,
  stream from public URLs. The deploy flow ships as a plugin
  (`/plugin install …-deploy`) so hosts are swappable — the client
  never locks you in.
- **Shell escape.** Prefix any REPL line with `!` to run the rest as a
  shell command directly in your terminal — no tokens, no approval
  prompt, no agent round-trip (e.g. `! git status`).

## What you need

- A supported OS: macOS (arm64 or x86_64), Linux (arm64 or x86_64), or
  Windows (arm64 or x86_64).
- At least one LLM API key — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter,
  Agentic Press, DashScope, DeepSeek, Z.ai, NVIDIA NIM, NSTDA Thai LLM,
  or Azure AI Foundry. (Or a local Ollama / LMStudio install if you'd
  rather stay offline.)

[Chapter 2](ch02-installation.md) walks through installation and first
launch. [Chapter 6](ch06-providers-models-api-keys.md) covers where
and how to paste keys.

## How this manual is organised

**Part I** (chapters 2–19) is reference material: how to install it,
and then every user-facing feature explained once with the commands
and configuration you need — sessions, memory, KMS, tools, skills,
hooks, MCP, subagents, plugins, teams, plan mode, and scheduling.

**Part II** — walkthroughs of real projects from scratch (static
landing page, reservation site, news-aggregation agent, ending with
deploys to Agentic Press Hosting) — is planned for a future revision.

If you're new, read chapter 2 next. If you're migrating from Claude
Code, skip to chapters 6, 7, 11, and 13. If you're already familiar
with the basics and want what's new, the recent additions live in
chapter 9 (`/dream`), chapter 15 (`/agent` side-channels), chapter 18
(plan mode), and chapter 19 (scheduling).
